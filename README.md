## Overview

**Destroy the corporations!**

You play as a tank-mech hybrid, dead-set on dismantling the power structures that exist around you. In that case, it's corporate tie-ins. In order to destroy capitalism, you'll have to destroy the corporate propaganda that pops up.

Missiles take two hits to destroy each billboard. Fire your rockets using the right-click on your mouse. To morph between mech and tank forms, press the spacebar.

## Software

This game was made using Unity 2019.2.0f1 and Affinity Designer.
